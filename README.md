# GrenadeTurret

Have you ever wanted to have a turret that shoots grenades? Look no further than GrenadeTurret, a mod for turrets that replaces the bullet hits with "grenades" (really just an explosion).

In the current state, bullets will simply pass through you and only explode on wall collision, but this will be fixed in a future update.

## Installation

### Manual

1. Install BepInEx
2. Place `GrenadeTurret.dll` in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder

### Thunderstore

1. Click download
